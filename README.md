# Thyroid-Disease-Detection

Thyroid Disorder Detection Project
Objective Statement
The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of thyroid disorder detection. By employing advanced algorithms and data analytics, we aim to develop a robust and reliable system capable of analyzing diverse medical data, including thyroid function tests and imaging results. This machine learning-based solution is intended to assist healthcare professionals in the early and accurate identification of thyroid disorders, leading to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

Thyroid Detection Dataset Overview
The Thyroid Detection dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and made available on Kaggle, comprises 9172 observations with 31 attributes. This dataset is intended for the development and evaluation of machine learning models to detect thyroid disorders. Each observation represents a patient, and the attributes include demographic information, medical history, laboratory test results, and the target variable indicating the presence of hyperthyroidism.

Key Attributes
Demographic Information:

Age: The age of the patient (integer).
Sex: Gender identification of the patient (string).
Medical History:

On_thyroxine: Boolean indicating whether the patient is on thyroxine.
Query_on_thyroxine: Boolean indicating queries regarding thyroxine usage.
On_antithyroid_meds: Boolean indicating whether the patient is on antithyroid medications.
Sick: Boolean indicating whether the patient is sick.
Pregnant: Boolean indicating whether the patient is pregnant.
Thyroid_surgery: Boolean indicating whether the patient has undergone thyroid surgery.
I131_treatment: Boolean indicating whether the patient is undergoing I131 treatment.
Query_hypothyroid: Boolean indicating the patient's belief of having hypothyroidism.
Query_hyperthyroid: Boolean indicating the patient's belief of having hyperthyroidism.
Lithium: Boolean indicating whether the patient uses lithium.
Goitre: Boolean indicating whether the patient has goitre.
Tumor: Boolean indicating whether the patient has a tumor.
Hypopituitary: Float value indicating a condition related to the hyperpituitary gland.
Psych: Boolean indicating a psychological condition.
Laboratory Test Results:

TSH_measured: Boolean indicating whether TSH was measured.
TSH: Float value representing the TSH level in the blood.

T4U: Float value representing the T4U level in the blood.
FTI_measured: Boolean indicating whether FTI was measured.
FTI: Float value representing the FTI level in the blood.
TBG_measured: Boolean indicating whether TBG was measured.
TBG: Float value representing the TBG level in the blood.
Other Attributes:

Referral_source: String indicating the source of patient referral.
Target: String indicating the medical diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
Patient_id: String representing a unique identifier for each patient.

Objective of Thyroid Detection
The primary goal of thyroid detection using this dataset is to develop machine learning models capable of accurately identifying patients with hyperthyroidism based on a combination of demographic information and laboratory test results. The models aim to assist healthcare professionals in early and precise diagnosis, leading to timely intervention and improved patient care. The dataset provides a comprehensive representation of patient profiles, making it a valuable resource for the development and evaluation of thyroid disorder detection algorithms.
